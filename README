To run this suite of tests you need to have the following components (it is assumed 
you have node and yarn already installed)

    yarn add --dev jest-puppeteer
    yarn add --dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
    yarn add --dev @babel/preset-typescript 
    yarn add --dev @types/jest
    yarn add --dev jest typescript
    yarn add --dev ts-jest @types/jest
    yarn add --dev @types/fs-extra
    yarn add puppeteer-core
    yarn add puppeteer

If jest.config.js does not exist you can use this command
    yarn ts-jest config:init

If you want to report the test results
    yarn add jest-html-reporter

To run the test
    yarn test

The above command is defined in the script section of package.json and will run all js scripts 
in the project filtered by 
    testMatch: ['**/tests/**/*.test.(ts|js)'],
as appears in jest.config.js

To run a single test (login.test.js in this case)
    yarn test login
